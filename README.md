# PreCalculusInitialQuiz
Pre-calculus quiz that I often present to Calculus 1 students in the beginning of the semester in a ungradaded format. Soon to be added to my website. Javascript code turned in as an assignment from the Introduction to Javascript minor for the DS4H grant at Université Côte d'Azur. Feel free to clone and use in class or as homework.
