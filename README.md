# PreCalculusInitialQuiz
The pre-calculus quiz that I often present to Calculus 1 students at the beginning of the semester in an ungraded format. Soon to be added to my website. Javascript code turned in as an assignment from the Introduction to Javascript minor for the DS4H grant at Université Côte d'Azur. Feel free to clone and use it in class or as homework.
